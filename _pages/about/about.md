  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  We collect speech samples from volunteers who stutter, ensuring data privacy and ethical compliance. Each sample is analyzed and annotated by certified speech-language pathologists. Our methods adhere to international research ethics standards with approvals obtained from the participants.
