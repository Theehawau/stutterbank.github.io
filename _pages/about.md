<h2> Our Approach </h2>

We collect speech samples from volunteers who stutter, ensuring data privacy and ethical compliance. Each sample is analyzed and annotated by certified speech-language pathologists. Our methods adhere to international research ethics standards with approvals obtained from the participants.

### Key Objectives
- Develop an AI-based system to automatically detect and assess stuttering severity.
- ​Build and expand an annotated database of speech samples from people who stutter.
- Validate AI models through clinical collaborations.


### Methodology
✔️ Data Collection:
- Audiovisual samples of Arabic & English speech from stuttering individuals.
- Manual annotation by speech-language pathologists.

✔️ Model Development:
- Initial AI models trained on annotated data.
- Continuous improvement through machine learning iterations.

✔️ Validation & Impact Assessment:
- Comparing AI-generated assessments with human expert ratings.

**Impact:** 

- Provides real-time stuttering severity analysis.
- Enhances speech therapy treatment precision.
- Contributes to global research on communication disorders.
- Facilitates clinical trials for pharmaceutical research.
