<!-- ## Stutter Bank! -->

This project aims to develop a comprehensive, open-access dataset of stuttered speech samples, collected from individuals who stutter. This dataset will serve as the foundation for creating AI-driven tools to assess stuttering severity objectively and in real-time, aiding both clinicians and researchers in the field of speech therapy. By leveraging annotated data from speech-language pathologists, we aim to create a real-time, objective assessment tool for therapists and researchers.
